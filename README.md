## Performance Analysis of MySQL vs Mongodb using Medicaid Drug Rebate Program data

### Introduction
The primary objective of this study is to delve into a comprehensive performance comparison between MySQL and MongoDB
This research aims to yield valuable insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of MySQL and MongoDB within the realm of complex healthcare datasets and intends to offer actionable guidance to healthcare professionals and database administrators seeking optimal solutions for managing complex healthcare repositories.


### Methodology
Our methodology targets refining hierarchical models in MongoDB and MySQL databases, specifically focusing on parent-child table relationships. 
Its goal is to improve data retrieval, storage, and query execution efficiency within these distinct database setups. 
The system's key objectives involve a thorough performance assessment, comparing operations between parent and child tables in both MongoDB and MySQL.
Through methodical use of performance metrics, query executions, and controlled experiments, the proposed system aims to uncover optimization opportunities, streamlining hierarchical data management in MongoDB's document-based architecture and MySQL's structured relational model.
We evaluated the performance metrics of MySQL and MongoDB databases for a range of operations. 
Testing for data retrieval, insertion, update, deletion, and query executions in both MySQL and MongoDB installations will be part of the assessment.
In order to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each database system in terms of speed, scalability, and efficiency, the performance metrics will be measured and compared.
The objective is to extract knowledge about each database's appropriateness for various use cases and workloads.


### Conclusion
MySQL managing complex operations, excelling in intricate tasks like joins and aggregations across multiple tables.
Its efficiency spans from data loading to maintaining data integrity in complex relational structures.
In contrast, MongoDB, adept at simpler queries and NoSQL structures, struggles with intricate joins across collections, impacting its performance.
MySQL's strength lies in complex relational tasks, while MongoDB excels in simpler NoSQL operations.
The choice between them hinges on application needs, data complexity, and operational intricacies.
Its efficiency from data loading to maintaining data integrity within complex setups is commendable.
Conversely, MongoDB's proficiency in simpler queries and NoSQL structures highlights its suitability for straightforward operations. 
However, its limitations with intricate joins across collections affect its performance in such scenarios.
Ultimately, the choice between these databases should align with specific application requirements, considering factors like data complexity and operational intricacies to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
